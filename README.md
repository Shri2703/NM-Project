Exercise Calorie Prediction
This repository contains the code and resources for predicting calorie expenditure during exercise using machine learning models.

Overview
The objective of this project is to classify exercise data based on parameters like duration, pulse, and max pulse

 into calorie categories using machine learning techniques. By automating the classification process, we aim to gain insights into the relationship between exercise parameters and calorie burn, facilitating personalized fitness recommendations and promoting healthier lifestyles.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains exercise records with features such as duration, pulse, and max pulse, along with the corresponding calorie expenditure. Before modeling, we preprocess the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and defining calorie ranges for classification.

Modeling Approach
We explore various machine learning models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) to determine the most suitable for calorie classification. Hyperparameter tuning is performed via grid search and cross-validation techniques, and ensemble methods like Voting Classifier and Stacking are experimented with for enhanced prediction accuracy.

Results
Our best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X%, precision of Y%, recall of Z%, and F1-score of W%. The model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, performing consistently well on unseen test data. Visualization of the confusion matrix highlights the model's ability to correctly classify exercise sessions into different calorie categories.
